# Retrofit_Moshi
**Sample Code for Lesson 11 Retrofit Moshi**

This repo is a sample code shown in classroom to study Retrofit, Moshi and Glide within Android Development.
It corresponds to Lesson 11 "Connect to the Internet" of the module "Multimedia and Mobile Devices Programming".
We've developed an app that uses API REST from https://dog.ceo/dog-api/.

In the first commit, we can get a list of breeds and a random URL image of a dog.
There is an option to get both info JSON formatted and another one to extract only the URL of the random image from the JSON formatted response.

In the second commit, we display the random image using Glide instead of showing its URL.
